----- GAME IDEAS -----
Enemies travel along different paths.
You can place towers on the map to shoot at them.
Manual shooting, switch tower by pressing a key.
Arrow keys to rotate the tower's gun.
Potentially a low-framerate game where everything (incl. arrows) moves an integer number of tiles each frame.
